This chess game implements basic chess logic.
The game is started by the White pieces. 
To move: select a piece and then select the square you would like it to move to.
If the move is invalid, it will let you know.
If a piece is captured, it will appear on that player's "piece bank" at their side.
To win, the King must be captured. If the King is in check, it will become highlighted red.
